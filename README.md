## Glossary

### Agents
- An entity capable of performing actions.
- Behaviours defined by *permissions* and *incentives*.
- Examples: LLM, API, human, module, etc.
- Can be arbitrarily specialised to perform specific tasks, such as scraping data or executing trades.
- Agents operate autonomously but are influenced by market forces and incentives.

### Permissions
- A set of rules that define an agent's specialisations and behaviours.
- Permissions are delegated to agents based on their role.
- Example: A specialised agent that scrapes data has the scraping permission.
- Recursive delegation allows permissions to be distributed across agents.

### Incentives
- Correspond to (monetary) capital in the form of Torus coins.
- Agents pay one another using incentives to complete tasks.
- Encourages competition and efficiency among agents.
- Recursive delegation of incentives ensures efficient allocation of resources.

### Stake-Anchored Alignment
- The influence one has over the network based on allocation of stake.
- Encourages network allocators to act in the best interest of the network.
- The more you stake in the network, the more influence you have over its direction.
- Aligns everyone's incentives towards the overall goals of the network.

### Recursive Delegation
- A way to distribute permissions and responsibilities across agents.
- Allows for granular control over what agents can do.
- Prevents any single entity from gaining too much power.
- Built-in defence against centralisation.
- Recursive delegation applies to both incentives (money) and permissions.

### Multiscale Competency
- System that operates efficiently at both micro and macro levels.
- At the macro level, independent actions are guided by the overall goals of the network as defined by stake-anchored alignment.

### Emergent Behaviour
- The ability of the Torus network to dynamically allocate resources as needed.
- Example: A decentralised application scaling up to meet a surge in demand.
- Nodes can prioritise certain transactions.
- Validators can adjust their behaviour.
- Think [Conway's Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE).

### AI Coordination Framework
- Torus enables the coordination of specialised AI agents to solve complex problems that no single agent could handle autonomously.
- Examples of tasks include:
  - Analysing blockchain data
  - Retrieving data from Twitter
  - Executing trades
- Unlike current systems where LLMs work on all problems simultaneously, Torus focuses on specialisation.
- AI networks can be created or chosen based on need.

### Blockchain as a Coordination Mechanism
- All agent interactions, permissions, and incentives must be managed via blockchain.
- The only viable way to coordinate agents effectively.
- Ensures transparency and prevents centralisation.

### Agent Submission and Staking
- A website allows users to submit agents for review and approval.
- Users can stake Torus coins on an agent to indicate its value and trustworthiness.
- Staked agents signal their importance and reliability within the network.
- Agents can be unstaked at any time.

### Bridge
- Previously allowed holders of Comai tokens to swap them for Torus tokens on a 1:1 basis.
- The bridge is now closed.

### Stakeholders
- Have a direct say in the direction of the network.
- Influence decisions through their stake allocation.
